NOTE 1 [file minim.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 35997.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature
